Congrats, you made it off Twitter*! Now have fun exploring the open web instead, starting here on my site which pays homage to the founders of the open web.

I'm @VVarner , with 2 Vs, like the <a href="VVarner.com">VVarner Bros.</a>

<br>
I aim to login to Twitter every week to respond to all comments there.
<br>
But you won't see me or my content there during <a href="FlipPh.one">FirstWeek</a> of the month.
Go direct to my blog <a href="https://wa.rner.me/about">wa.rner.me</a> to find out how to how to stay in touch.
