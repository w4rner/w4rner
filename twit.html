<br>

Congrats, you made it off Twitter*!
<br>
Now have a look around the open web instead, starting right here: my homage to the open web's founders.
<br>
Or just go outside!

<br>
<br>
I'm writing a crowdsourced musical that pokes fun at Twitter's first 10 years, which only ended in 2017.

<br>
But I'm not a complete critic. You can see my parody pages for <a href="https://F.Bu.rner.me">Facebook</a> & <a href="https://linkstagram.ceruleansounds.com">Instagram</a>, which I believe have been worse forces on society in that order.
<br>
I syndicate my tech blogs posts to Twitter to amplify their reach, and I aim to login to Twitter every week to respond to all comments there.
<br>
But you won't see me or my content there during <a href="https://FlipPh.one">FirstWeek</a> of the month.
Go direct to my blog <a href="https://wa.rner.me/about">wa.rner.me</a> to find out how to how to stay in touch.
