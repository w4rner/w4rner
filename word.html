#WORD
"ABCD-compliant” (adj.)
ABCD stands for those 4-letter acronyms which force techy folk to treat humans with basic respect.
Examples: GDPR, PECR & CCPA (not to be confused with CCCP, which failed to).

Usage: blog.w4.rner.me/about.

	<i>Latin motto for cryptocurrency speculators.<br>
Where ‘ars gratia artis’ meant art for art’s sake, it means:
“Crypto for the sake of burial”, burial as in:<br>
a) hoarding<br>
b) human climate extinction which this accelerates<br>

	<i>4-letter acronyms which force techy folk to do something which should be easy: treat humans with basic respect. <br>
	e.g. GDPR, DCIA, PECR & CCPA (not to be confused with CCCP, which failed to).</i>

	texperiment n.
	</dt>
		<dd>
		<i>A minimalist method of trialling technology, where you use a product intensely for a set period - usually 7 days - and then immediately take it away for the same period, in order to gain perspective on whether you truly want to incorporate the product into your life long-term. <br>
		Portmanteau of 'tech' and 'experiment'.<br>
e.g. Only using the first half of a 14-day trial so you can make a better judgement when it actually comes time to sign up yearly. Or FirstWeek FlipPh.one, where you go without a smartphone (i.e. an infinite bundle of products) for 7 days in order to figure out which functions to use long-term. <br>

600,000 words … 3.5 million quotations … over 1000 years of English

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is widely regarded as the accepted authority on the English language. It is an unsurpassed guide to the meaning, history, and pronunciation of 600,000 words— past and present—from across the English-speaking world.

As a historical dictionary, the OED is very different from dictionaries of current English, in which the focus is on present-day meanings. You’ll still find present-day meanings in the OED, but you’ll also find the history of individual words, and of the language—traced through 3 million quotations, from classic literature and specialist periodicals to film scripts and cookery books.

The OED started life more than 150 years ago. Today, the dictionary is in the process of its first major revision. Updates revise and extend the OED at regular intervals, each time subtly adjusting our image of the English language. -->
