Bio Blurb
</h2>
<p>
W4RNER is how <a href="https://LaurenceWarner.com">Laurence Warner</a> signs off on his code. He received a
<a href="https://w4rner.com/ma">M.A.</a> in Computational Social Science from U Chicago in 2019 on a UK Fulbright Postgraduate Award. He was the host of "<a href="https://Wrnr.me/fulbright">net:work? A Fulbrighter Conversation</a>" the network's flagship longform content series. He is one of the directors and animators of <a href="https://crystalcubed.com">CrystalCUBED</a>, a Web Design Center who did a recent 22-minute computer generated animation about turning a Flip Phone inside out. He is also one of the
authors of <a href="https://DinnerSpinner.FastFeedApps.com">DinnerSpinner</a>, developed in collaboration between <a href="https://fastfeedapps.com">Fast Feed Apps</a> and U Chicago.

Real Life
</h2>
<p> Onward to the first person. My real life interests include

</p><ul>
<li><b>writing science fiction</b>
<ul>
<li>Science Fiction Musical, Written in Chicago, Set in Orange County, 92650. Snowflak.es. contact@ceruleansounds.com.

</li><li> The best SF musical in town. Has a huge selection of sheet music books
and a thriving licensing business as well. The last four good songs in the
series that we've written are on <a href="https://instagram.com/SoCalSnowflakes">the.gram</a>. Roughly 50% of <a href="https://blog.w4rner.com/categories/arts-books/">actual books I've
read lately</a> are SF or fantasy. Of course,
if you include mediocre or flat-out trash books, the percentage plummets...
</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p></li>
<!-- <li><b>learning martial arts</b>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://www2.kali-group.com/kali/index.html">Minnesota Kali Group</a> 328 East Hennepin Ave., Suite 200, Minneapolis, MN 55414, 612-331-6438.
 </li><li> This school is run by Rick Faye, certified under Dan Inosanto,
who was a student of Bruce Lee. Lee's personal art of Jeet Kune Do
pioneered the formerly heretical concept of combining the best aspects
of several martial arts traditions. I'm studying a mixture of
Kali/Silat, Filipino and Indonesian weapons-based arts; Muay Thai,
aka Thai boxing, a kickboxing art; Wing Chun, a style of Chinese gong
fu (popularly known as kung fu); Shoot Wrestling, a ground-based
Japanese grappling art; and Savate, a French kickboxing style. Rick is
one of the greatest teachers I've ever met, and kickboxing is
completely addictive...
<p>
For more about kali, see the home page of my friend <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/~jswan/">Jay Swan</a>, who first
introduced me to the art.
</p></li></ul>

<p>
</p></li> -->

<li><b> making live music</b>
<ul>
<li> The best (and usually
the loudest) live music. Hawaiian shirts recommended for
those who want to be close to the stage. It's unsurprisingly located
at
</li><li>CeruleanSounds.com
</li></ul>

</li></ul>

Finally, <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/89743309/Boris-cartoon">Boris's Bridge</a>
is one of the greatest cartoons in the universe. (The other is Dilbert.)
