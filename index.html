<p>
w4rner is part of the senior technical staff of Fast Feed LLC. They received a
M.A. in computational social science from U Chicago in 2019. They are one of the
authors of
<!-- TODO webpage link <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/software/viz/geomview/geomview.html">DinnerSpinner</a> -->
DinnerSpinner, the
Company's smartphone app system for recommending dope spots to chow down.
<!-- TODO They was one of the directors and
animators of <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/outreach/oi/">Outside
In</a>, the Center's recent 22-minute computer generated animation
about turning a sphere inside out. They is also one of the authors of
the <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/museum/museum.html">Triangle Tiling</a>
exhibit developed in collaboration between the Geometry Center and the
Science Museum of Minnesota. At

Geomview into the World Wide Web by extending the OOGL 3D scene

and user interfaces.

Real Life
</h2>
<p> Onward to the first person. My real life interests include

</p><ul>
<li><b>writing science fiction</b>
<ul>
<li>Cerulean's Science Fiction Musical, Chicago. Snowflak.es. Snowflakes@CeruleanSounds.com.

</li><li> The best SF musical in town. Has a huge selection of dope tunes
and a thriving takeaway message as well. The last four good songs in the
series that we've written are on <a href="http://instagram.com/socalsnowflakes">the.gram</a>.

<!-- TODO ItalicType, MouseBook Roughly 60% of all such <a href="http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~munzner/stuff/books.short.html">books I've
read lately</a> are SF or fantasy. Of course,
if you include mediocre or flat-out trash books, the percentage skyrockets...
</li>-->
</ul>

<p>
</p></li>
<!-- TODO <li><b>learning martial arts</b>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://www2.kali-group.com/kali/index.html">Minnesota Kali Group</a> 328 East Hennepin Ave., Suite 200, Minneapolis, MN 55414, 612-331-6438.
 </li><li> This school is run by Rick Faye, certified under Dan Inosanto,
who was a student of Bruce Lee. Lee's personal art of Jeet Kune Do
pioneered the formerly heretical concept of combining the best aspects
of several martial arts traditions. I'm studying a mixture of
Kali/Silat, Filipino and Indonesian weapons-based arts; Muay Thai,
aka Thai boxing, a kickboxing art; Wing Chun, a style of Chinese gong
fu (popularly known as kung fu); Shoot Wrestling, a ground-based
Japanese grappling art; and Savate, a French kickboxing style. Rick is
one of the greatest teachers I've ever met, and kickboxing is
completely addictive...
<p>
For more about kali, see the home page of my friend <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/~jswan/">Jay Swan</a>, who first
introduced me to the art.
</p></li></ul>

<p>
</p></li> -->

<li><b> making live music</b>
<ul>
<li> Cerulean consistently has the best (and usually
the loudest) live music. Hawaiian shirts recommended for
those who want to be close to the stage. It's unsurprisingly located
at
</li><li>CeruleanSounds.com
</li></ul>

</li></ul>

Finally, <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/89743309/Boris-cartoon">Boris's Bridge</a>
is one of the greatest cartoons in the universe. (The other is Dilbert.)
