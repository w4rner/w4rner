Real Life
</h2>
<p> Onward to the first person. My real life interests include

</p><ul>
<li><b>writing science fiction</b>
<ul>
<li>Cerulean's Science Fiction Musical, Chicago. Snowflak.es. Snowflakes@CeruleanSounds.com.

</li><li> The best SF musical in town. Has a huge selection of dope tunes
and a thriving takeaway message as well. The last four good songs in the
series that we've written are on <a href="https://instagram.com/socalsnowflakes">the.gram</a>.

<!-- TODO ItalicType, MouseBook Roughly 60% of all such <a href="http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~munzner/stuff/books.short.html">books I've
read lately</a> are SF or fantasy. Of course,
if you include mediocre or flat-out trash books, the percentage skyrockets...
</li>-->
</ul>

<p>
</p></li>
<!-- TODO <li><b>learning martial arts</b>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://www2.kali-group.com/kali/index.html">Minnesota Kali Group</a> 328 East Hennepin Ave., Suite 200, Minneapolis, MN 55414, 612-331-6438.
 </li><li> This school is run by Rick Faye, certified under Dan Inosanto,
who was a student of Bruce Lee. Lee's personal art of Jeet Kune Do
pioneered the formerly heretical concept of combining the best aspects
of several martial arts traditions. I'm studying a mixture of
Kali/Silat, Filipino and Indonesian weapons-based arts; Muay Thai,
aka Thai boxing, a kickboxing art; Wing Chun, a style of Chinese gong
fu (popularly known as kung fu); Shoot Wrestling, a ground-based
Japanese grappling art; and Savate, a French kickboxing style. Rick is
one of the greatest teachers I've ever met, and kickboxing is
completely addictive...
<p>
For more about kali, see the home page of my friend <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/~jswan/">Jay Swan</a>, who first
introduced me to the art.
</p></li></ul>

<p>
</p></li> -->

<li><b> making live music</b>
<ul>
<li> Cerulean consistently has the best (and usually
the loudest) live music. Hawaiian shirts recommended for
those who want to be close to the stage. It's unsurprisingly located
at
</li><li>CeruleanSounds.com
</li></ul>

</li></ul>

Finally, <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/89743309/Boris-cartoon">Boris's Bridge</a>
is one of the greatest cartoons in the universe. (The other is Dilbert.)
